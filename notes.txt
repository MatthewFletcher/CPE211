Phases of writing a program:
0. Why are you writing the program
1. Understand problem, solution, and algorithm used
2. Implementation: convert algorithm into programming language
2. Check for syntax and logic errors
3. Execute the program and change it to meet changing requirements


A programming language is a simplified version of english that adheres to a strict set of rules

Documentation: external and internal 


Think first, code later


Language types
Machine language: 1 and 0 used by computer
Assembly language: low level using mnemonics to represent machine language instructions
Assembler: Program to translate assembly language to machine language 
High level language: Language close to english that can be translated to machine languages
Compiler: program to translates high level language to machine language
Src program: program written in high level language
Object ptoram: machine language version of the program 


Four ways of structring statements:
Sequentially: Instructions executed one after the other
Selection (if and switch) condition control, pick one of multiple choices
Loopo: Perform same instructions repetitively until a condition is met
Subprogram: Pass control over to another set of instructions, allows for breaking up a large program into smaller ujnits

Ethics:
Software pirary: copying of software without permission of its creator
Privacy of data: do not take advantage of special access to confidential data
Use of computer resources: do not use computer resources without permission 
Software engineering: Programmers have a responsibility for developing software that is free from errors
